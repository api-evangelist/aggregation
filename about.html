<h1>About API Aggregation</h1>
<p>This is a project site to track on the different approaches to API aggregation.</p>
<p>I host individual research projects and sections of API Evangelist as their own Github repositories.  This way projects can evolve on their, independent of the overall site.</p>
<p>Aggregation represents an important trend in the evolution of APIs, and the need to mix, reuse and evolve API resources..</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this research, contact me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>

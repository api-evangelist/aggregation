<h1>About API Aggregation</h1>
<p>This is a project site to track on a new breed of service proviers that are aggregating APIs into new types of APIs.</p>
<p>I host individual research projects and sections of API Evangelist as their own Github repositories.  This way projects can evolve on their, independint of the overall site.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this research, contact me at <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cloudscaling, an EMC company, has released a drop-in replacement for OpenStacks existing Nova EC2 API.Using this, OpenStack users can interact with OpenStack Compute using a set of APIs that is compatible with the Amazon AWS EC2 APIs.According to EMCs Randy Bias, the drop-in replacement has been tested exhaustively with the AWS unified CLI tool, a python CLI for driving all of the AWS services and is now ready for prime time.Bias says that EMC is committed to maintaining the drop-in replacement and is open to the possibility of it becoming an optional OpenStack plug-in.OpenStack is an open source cloud computing platform that is used to run public and private clouds.</p>

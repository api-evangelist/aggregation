<p>A number of significant developments over the past 5 years have propelled us into what some call an API economy… APIGEE has a great video explaining this and is definitely worth seeing.In a nutshell, because of the rapid proliferation of devices and apps, if you have some data that is remotely useful, it needs to be accessible through an API.This has led many companies – big and small – to develop proprietary APIs that are either public or accessible to partners.While API technology has also matured over the past 5-10 years, developing applications against an API (or a set of APIs) is still not easy.Some of the more established APIs are not necessarily the most modern in design, which makes integration a challenge requiring time and valuable resources.</p>

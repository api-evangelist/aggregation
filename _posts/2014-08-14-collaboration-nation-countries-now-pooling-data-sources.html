<p>Oh, how the meta have fallen.On July 8, the Global Repertoire Database, an £8m effort to become a single data source for all musical works from publishers and collection societies, announced its demise.Two short weeks later, MusicMark and Armonia were in talks of collaborating.These two licencing platforms (from North America and Europe, respectively) both recognise the need for a collaborative, authoritative repository of musical works information and are continuing to push forward on this endeavour.

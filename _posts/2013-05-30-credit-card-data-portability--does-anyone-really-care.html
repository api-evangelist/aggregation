<p>When accepting payments online (Authorize.Net, SagePay, Braintree etc) you can elect to store your customer’s credit card data.It’s an obvious requirement for recurring payments and potentially a good practice for one time payments (by pre-populating a shopping cart for a returning customer).So what happens to your customer’s credit card data if you decide to change payment providers?The answer is “it depends”.</p>

<p>We’ve spent 2013 on the road, hosting a series of events called APIs & IPAs in several cities.So far we’ve been to Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, Boulder, Denver, Kansas City and Chicago.Here’s a bit more about the events and why we do them:
 When it comes to developer marketing, evangelism and outreach, we’ve dabbled in just about every approach.We’ve hosted our own hackathons, sponsored different types of hackathons, hosted online contests and attended, hosted, sponsored and spoken at tons of events.Hackathons have been great.</p>

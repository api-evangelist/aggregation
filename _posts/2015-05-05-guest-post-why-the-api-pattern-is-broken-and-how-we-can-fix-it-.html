<p>Guest Post: Why The API Pattern Is Broken And How We Can Fix It
   05 May 2015   
This a guest post by Owen Rubel, fellow API architect, and master of api automation, creator of #iostate, #apichaining.I am working with Owen to better understand API Chaining, and how it can be applied in several projects I am working on.Owen was kind enough to craft this post, to better help me understand is vision, as well as share with my audience.If you want to find out more about Owen, you can follow him on Twiiter @OwenRubel, and visit his Github repository for the more technical side of his work.In the early days of API development, the concept of the API was simple.</p>

<p>This XML structure is not intuitive, making it hard to represent in code.JSON: 
JSON’s structure is intuitive, making it easy to read and map directly to domain objects in whatever programming language is being used.JSON is limiting, but that’s a good thing: JSON is limited in terms of what objects can be modeled.Some may think XML is better because more objects can be modeled and it doesn’t prohibit developers.But even though JSON prohibits developers, it is in a positive way, making the code simpler, more predictable, and easy to read.</p>

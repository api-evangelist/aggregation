<p>Today, we announced new support for online retailers to get up and running with analytics in minutes.Our plugins for Magento, WooCommerce, WP eCommerce, and Goodsie ecommerce platforms let online merchants install Segment, and turn on any tool they want to use in seconds.And, our Ecommerce API sits underneath the plugins and works for any company thatâ€™s selling stuff online.But why do ecommerce companies need access to all of these tools with the flick of a switch?What value do they provide?</p>

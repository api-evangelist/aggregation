<p>As our clients integrate the Documents Hub into their app and connect to all of the leading cloud file storage services through one API, it has become clear that a pre-built user interface would accelerate their time to market.Continuing to uphold our mission of making developer’s lives easier, we built our first free and open source project, Filebrowser.io, to solve this problem by creating a user interface for them to build into their product.Filebrowser.io is a cloud file browser that integrates seamlessly into your application, allowing your customers to access all of their files without ever leaving your app.</p>

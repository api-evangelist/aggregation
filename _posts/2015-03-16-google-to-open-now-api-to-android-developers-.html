<p>Developers are about to gain access to Google Now, the popular card-based information service from Google.Google didnt share too many details about the forthcoming API, but it will allow most third-party apps to surface information on Android smartphones, tablets and smartwatches.Speaking at the SXSW conference over the weekend, Aparna Chennapragada, director of product management for Google Now, tipped off attendees that the API is on the way.Google already offers a Now API, but it is limited to just 40 apps and services at the moment.The new API would expand to everyone.</p>

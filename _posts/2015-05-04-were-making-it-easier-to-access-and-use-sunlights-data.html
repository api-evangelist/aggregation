<p>When I started late last year as Sunlight’s new president, I promised to make it my mission to streamline and simplify Sunlight’s focus so we can maximize the impact of our work.Today, I’m pleased to follow up on that promise by announcing a major initiative we’ve just embarked upon to make it easier for you to access and use the data we open up about government and political influence.In the coming months, we will consolidate our resources and will roll out a flagship suite of websites, mobile apps and a single, unified API with an associated data explorer.One valuable bit of recurrent feedback I’ve received about Sunlight’s first nine years: Our early experiments in creating branded projects that focused on one dataset resulted in us offering too many different sites.By scattering our efforts across myriad sites and tools, we hid the true potential of the underlying data.</p>

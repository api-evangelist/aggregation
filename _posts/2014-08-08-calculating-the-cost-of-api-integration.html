<p>Research: Research is a key, yet often overlooked step in the process.Research includes familiarizing yourself with the API- it’s nuances including data structures, protocols, and user authentication. If done thoroughly, this step will set you up for success.The amount of research needed depends on the category of cloud services you’ll be working with; For example, creating an integration to a CRM service is typically more complex than creating an integration to a documents storage service.For this reason, you’ll want to budget 2 full days for researching a documents endpoint, and 3 full days for a CRM endpoint.</p>

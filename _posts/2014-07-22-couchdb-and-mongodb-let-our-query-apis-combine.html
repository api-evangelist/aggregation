<p>Why Cloudant chose MongoDB’s query syntax for our database service, and why we’re contributing it back to Apache CouchDB™    
find() operation, adapted to run on Cloudant’s distributed database as a service (DBaaS).Today, I’m excited to announce that we intend to contribute the Cloudant Query functionality to the Apache CouchDB™ project.I want to reiterate a few points from my talk at MongoDB World on the significance of this development.Track this contribution in CouchDBs JIRA.Developer adoption is the new standard    
Firstly, we want to make it easier for developers to learn and use CouchDB.</p>

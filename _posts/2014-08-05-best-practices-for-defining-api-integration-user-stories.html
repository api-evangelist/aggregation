<p>User Personas vs.System Personas 
By developing user stories in the system persona, we as Product Managers can become too focused on the technical aspects of the integration instead of the collaborative user experience that we’re trying to establish. System based integration stories don’t enable the Product Manager to fully visualize the workflow that the user will experience; they  guide the integration as a technical solution but not as effectively as a business solution.A great user persona is written from the point-of-view of an end user.That is contrary to a system persona, designed to specify technical interactions between systems.</p>

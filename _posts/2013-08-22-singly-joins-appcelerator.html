<p>After almost three years helping developers integrate with 3rd party APIs, we are very excited to announce that we’ve been acquired by Appcelerator.We’ve been very impressed with what they have built in the mobile space, their strong dedication to open source, as well as their incredible community of nearly 500,000 developers.The very best news about this: Singly will only get better as we join Appcelerator.We’ll begin work very soon to integrate Singly AppFabric and DataFabric into the Appcelerator Platform and Titanium.Appcelerator offers tons of great app development tools and mobile backend services (push notifications, analytics, etc) — adding Singly’s API integration management into that will make it even easier to build great mobile apps.</p>

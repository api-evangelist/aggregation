<p>Google Now, the card-based dashboard that provides a custom overview of what’s coming up on your schedule, how hellish your commute will be, what news you might like to read and more, is an immensely helpful tool for Android users.Google is about to make it a whole lot more powerful.At the moment, Google Now mostly pulls from Google services like Gmail, Maps, and search.It surfaces content from sites you visit regularly, summarizes your calendar, offers travel directions and estimated arrival times, and provides weather alerts and restaurant recommendations based on your location.It’s a helpful personal assistant, but it’s limited in scope.</p>

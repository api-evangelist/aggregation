<p>Kloudless launched at Disrupt NY 2013 today with its service for moving data from email to different cloud platforms through connectors which act like pipes that flow between the different services.The service offers a plugin that the user installs in Outlook or as an extension through their web browser to use in Gmail or other apps, said CEO Eliot Sun.Kloudless does not store any data, nor files, the service sits in the middle, acting basically as just a pipeline.When looking at Kloudless, think of services such as ifttt but with less automation and more ability to customize how data flows out of email and into other services.The idea is to give people more flexibility when moving data.</p>

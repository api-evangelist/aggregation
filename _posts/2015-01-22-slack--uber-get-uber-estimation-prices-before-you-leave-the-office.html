Since Uber launched its API back in August, I’ve been playing with it to built an app to track Uber price surges and most recently, a Slack bot to get Uber price estimations from one distance to another.Since we use Slack as our main internal communication tool at 3scale, it comes in very handy to have this bot available when you need an Uber to go to a meeting, an event, or just to get back home.To build this bot I used Slack’s API, Uber’s API, Google Maps API, and also APItools.By using APItools I avoided having to have a server.You can read more about creating bots for Slack with APItools here.</p>

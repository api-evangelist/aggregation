<p>The Sunlight Foundation has announced that it is rolling out new websites, mobile applications, a unified API and an enhanced data explorer tool in the coming months.The Sunlight Foundation is also in the process of developing two major platforms, one that focuses on the federal government and one that focuses on state governments.The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes transparency in government, is organizing and consolidating its data under two flagship platforms so that both federal and state government data will be comprehensive and easier to use.Building two platforms also makes it possible to build a single, unified Sunlight API that will allow programmatic access to all of Sunlights data.Capitol Words is a tool that lets users explore and compare words used most frequently by members of Congress.</p>

<p>Peach Payments, an emerging market web and mobile payments solution provider, has launched its Smart Payments Platform, a new unified API.The unified API brings together the functionality that formerly existed in two separate APIs: a front-end widget for checkout side integration, and a server-to-server API for back-office integration.The same API is now used for all integrations, whether it be browser, mobile, server, or otherwise.“Now we offer a unified API so developers don’t have to work with two APIs to get the full benefits of our platform and services,” Rahul Jain, Peach Payments co-founder, told Disrupt Africa.“The unified REST API enables developers to do both the front-end/checkout page integration and the back-office operations.</p>

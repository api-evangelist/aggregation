In a nutshell, because of the rapid proliferation of devices and apps, if you have some data that is remotely useful, it needs to be accessible through an API. This has led many companies &ndash; big and small &ndash; to develop proprietary APIs that are either public or accessible to partners.\nWhile API technology has also matured over the past 5-10 years, developing applications against an API (or a set of APIs) is still not easy. Some of the more established APIs are not necessarily the most modern in design, which makes integration a challenge requiring time and valuable resources. Often these happen to be important APIs that many people&nbsp;have to&nbsp;integrate with.\nSo there&rsquo;re two main problems here: First, there are too many APIs, and second, many are not easy to integrate with. There&rsquo;s actually a third &ndash; hidden but significant &ndash; issue in that there isn&rsquo;t enough uniformity in the syntax and semantics of APIs even within a single industry. While&nbsp;REST&nbsp;has done a lot to improve this situation, there&rsquo;re no &ldquo;enforced&rdquo; rules governing syntax and semantics.\nFortunately, we believe there is an elegant solution that addresses these problems, and we call it API Aggregation. The idea is to bring key APIs within an industry under a single umbrella. It would act as a gateway to the data available through those APIs by providing a single uniform and modern API. The ease and speed of integration that this approach provides are significant. Improvement in time-to-market and access to the pool of untapped data can open up many possibilities.\nAPI aggregation actually solves a fourth problem that can be a show-stopper in any API integration project. APIs change all the time and keeping up with the change is not easy. By shifting the burden of upkeep to a single provider, developers can rest assured that their work doesn&rsquo;t break and they can stay focused on data analysis and visualization, rather than data collection and integration.","website":"http:\/\/www.adigami.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adigami","github":"https:\/\/github.com\/adigami","blog":"http:\/\/www.adigami.com\/blog\/","blogrss":"http:\/\/www.adigami.com\/feed\/","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/adigami-logo.png","screenshot":null,"tags":"Aggregation"},{"id":"1691","name":"Yodlee","summary":"Powered by the award-winning Yodlee platform, the Yodlee Interactive financial cloud is an innovation delivery system for entrepreneurs, partners, and developers to build the next generation of digital financial services, plus any service or process that can be created, improved, or enhanced by streamlined access to data, payments, and\/or digital security.","details":"Powered by the award-winning Yodlee platform, the Yodlee Interactive financial cloud is an innovation delivery system for entrepreneurs, partners, and developers to build the next generation of digital financial services, plus any service or process that can be created, improved, or enhanced by streamlined access to data, payments, and\/or digital security.","website":"http:\/\/www.yodlee.com\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yodlee","github":"https:\/\/github.com\/Yodlee","blog":"http:\/\/www.yodlee.com\/yodlee-moneycenter-blog\/","blogrss":"http:\/\/www.yodlee.com\/yodlee-moneycenter-blog\/feed\/","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/company\/yodlee-logo.png","screenshot":null,"tags":"Aggregation,Banking,Financial"},{"id":"37","name":"Deltacloud","summary":"Deltacloud provides the API server and drivers necessary for connecting to cloud providers.\nDeltacloud maintains&nbsp;long-term stability&nbsp;for scripts, tools and applications and&nbsp;backward compatibility&nbsp;across different versions.\nUsing single API Deltacloud enables management of resources in different clouds.\nStart an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start anothe","details":"Deltacloud provides the API server and drivers necessary for connecting to cloud providers.\nDeltacloud maintains&nbsp;long-term stability&nbsp;for scripts, tools and applications and&nbsp;backward compatibility&nbsp;across different versions.\nUsing single API Deltacloud enables management of resources in different clouds.\nStart an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on EC2 or RHEV-M.","website":"http:\/\/deltacloud.apache.org\/","twitter":"","github":"https:\/\/github.com\/deltacloud","blog":"","blogrss":"","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/serviceproviders\/delta_cloud_small.jpg","screenshot":null,"tags":"Aggregation"},{"id":"36","name":"FedAPI","summary":"Government data in easy to consume APIs.
